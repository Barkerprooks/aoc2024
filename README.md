# Advent of Code 2024

Hopefully this year I will complete the challenge.


A different language every day. 


Will try to keep up as best as I can. 

1. C++
    - part 1: `1873376`
    - part 2: `18997088`
```
g++ ./src/1/main.cpp -o day1; ./day1; rm day1
```
2. Lua
    - part 1: `306`
    - part 2: `366`
```
lua ./src/2/main.lua
```
3. Go
    - part 1: `n/a`
    - part 2: `n/a`
```
go run ./src/3/main.go
```

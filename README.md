# Advent of Code 2024
A different language each day. 
## Days
Assuming you have the compiler/interpreter in your `$PATH`, you can run the source code using any of the commands below.

You can also use the script `run-day.sh` to run a specific day.
```
# mark the script as executable
chmod +x ./run-day.sh

# example: this would run day 3
./run-day.sh 3
```
